    Programs designed to support people with mental health needs are vital in promoting recovery, resilience, and
    overall
    well-being. These can include outpatient counseling services that provide regular therapy sessions, inpatient or
    residential care for individuals in crisis, and community-based initiatives such as support groups and outreach
    clinics.
    Schools and workplaces often offer specialized programs to build awareness, reduce stigma, and provide early
    intervention, while crisis services like hotlines and mobile response teams deliver immediate assistance during
    emergencies. Preventive programs, including mindfulness workshops, fitness and nutrition initiatives, and digital
    mental
    health apps, also play a key role in helping individuals manage stress and maintain balance. Together, these
    programs
    create a comprehensive system of care that ensures people receive the right support at the right time.
